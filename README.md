## Overview  
This repository supports the RISC 2.0 initiative: expanding occupational health surveillance from commercial fishing to the broader agriculture, forestry and fishing (AgFF) sectors within the Pacific Northwest region (Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington).  
The goals of RISC 2.0 include:  
- Tracking regional injury/illness indicators in the AgFF sectors.  
- Identifying activity, setting, worker‐group and industry‐specific predictors of injury/illness.  
- Working with stakeholders (industry, labor, state/regional agencies) to translate findings into injury‐control actions.

Surveillance spans emergent systems (e.g., trauma/EMS) and lagging indicators (e.g., workers’ compensation) to document temporal trends, analyze settings, quantify severity and isolate high risk subgroups.

## Repository structure  
Based on the current organization of the repository, here’s an overview of file/folder structure and their functions:

| Directory / File                              | Purpose                                                                    |

| `ACS/`                                        | Contains code to access and analyze American Community Survey as is relevant to Region X and Agricultural Workers. |
| `Ag Indicator Reports/`                       | Existing reports on Ag Health Indicators collected through our region  |
| `Census of Ag/`                               | Code to access the Census of Ag API                   |

| `Fatality Data NW/`                           | Regional commercial fishing/agricultural/forestry fatality data.           |
| `Injury Data WA/`                             | Washington-specific injury data for AgFF sectors.                           |
| `Plots/`                                      | Visualizations (charts, graphs) generated by analysis scripts.              |
| `QWI/`                                        | Code to access the Federal QWI reports         |
